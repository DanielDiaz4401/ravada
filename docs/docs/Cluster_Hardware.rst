Cluster Hardware
================

Shared Storage
--------------

If you are planning to build a large cluster of Ravada nodes you may
go to an expensive shared storage infraestructure. Be aware this can
be a big deployment that can give access to thousands of users, but
it will be expensive and you may have some perfomance issues.

Ravada is easy to grow, so try first a single
`Server <http://ravada.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/Server_Hardware.html>`_
setup and you can add more later.

Recommendations
---------------
